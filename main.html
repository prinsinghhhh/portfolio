<div class="about">
<p>Hello, My name is Amritpal Singh. Im a self - taught graphic designer and web developer. I started learning programming in 10th grade (as I was interested in computers and technology from a very early age). Along with programming, I started developing an interest in graphic design too. I attended some online courses and watched videos of some of the top graphic designers. At an early stage, I used to design on CorelDraw and some basic design software. Later, I started designing on Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, etc. I learned some programming languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. I'm still learning some new languages. I started web development and graphic design because of my passion; hence, I don't have any certificates or formal education in these fields. Thank you
</p>
